/**
 * A quick tool for patching the boot_params check in the DSM kernel image
 * This lets you tinker with the initial ramdisk contents without disabling mount() features and modules loading
 *
 * The overall pattern we need to find is:
 *  - an CDECL function
 *  - does "LOCK OR [const-ptr],n" 4x
 *  - values of ORs are 1/2/4/8 respectively
 *  - [const-ptr] is always the same
 *
 * Usage: php patch-boot_params-check.php vmlinux vmlinux-mod
